- Evolutionary Neural Networks (Plastic, non-plastic). + Differential plasticity for transfer learning? 


- Traveling Salesman (title?)

Acknoledgements
I. Introduction + Preliminaries (Attacking NP-hard/complete TSP from different "angles", which will be traditional methods, heuristics, and novel metaheuristics)
II. Problem-oriented approach (problem description, what's been done so far, applications, etc.)
III. Traditional Methods (dynamic programming, nearest neighbor)
V. Other heuristics (2-opt, Lin Kernighan (is it k-opt?))
IV. Evolutionary approach (evolutionary algorithm along with the description of crossover types as well as function representations)
V. Real-life application (? if necessary; do some dynamic shit)
VI. Conclusion

In each section, provide pseudocode (or the actual code), time that it took to run, and statistics (graphs for convergence, ETA)
